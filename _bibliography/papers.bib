  title={Enhanced Localization of ArUco Markers for Autonomous Robotics: A Comparative Study},
  author={Minervini Alessandro and Buoso Davide and Quito Casas Jean Carlos and Fassio Davide and Messina Claudio Giuseppea and Marino Francesco and Guglieri Giorgio},
  year={2024},
  abstract={Autonomous drone technology increasingly enables their use in diverse applications, offering cost and time benefits in precision agriculture and surveillance. They are especially efficient in search and rescue and exploring hard-to-access areas. Navigating indoor settings and partially known environments poses significant challenges in autonomous robotics. This paper introduces a novel method that leverages depth image data to substantially improve performance in these contexts. We elucidate the method's design, showcasing its dependability and advantages over conventional approaches. Furthermore, the paper delineates the critical procedures for effective autonomous robot guidance, tackling complex obstacles inherent to the field.},

  title={SpanLuke: Enhancing Legal NER using SpanMarker and LoRA},
  author={Buoso Davide and Capuano Enrico and Caselli Andrea and Okpekpe Destiny},
  year={2024},
  abstract={Legal Named Entity Recognition is a focal point in NLP systems in legal domain, due to its potential to streamline processes and enhance decision-making accuracy. This paper delves into the SpanMarker technique for span-level representation of entity, the LUKE model for enhanced entity recognition and LoRA for efficient fine-tuning of large models. The study evaluates these methodologies, individually and in synergy, to improve the accuracy and performance of legal NLP systems. Additionally, a new dataset (EDGAR-NER) has been explored. In-depth experimentation reveals the potential of these approaches. This research contributes to ongoing efforts in leveraging NLP to enhance legal text process, reducing the time needed to train models to achieve this goal.},
