My name is Davide Buoso and I'm from Turin, Italy. I am enrolled in the Data Science and Engineering program at <a href='https://www.polito.it/'>Polytechnique University of Turin</a>. Currently, I am a Visiting Student at the <a href='#'>University of Oxford</a>, to complete my Master Thesis. I am working in the <a href='https://torrvision.com/index.html'>Torr Vision Group</a> (under PhD Student <a href='https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~frtim/'>Tim Franzmeyer</a>) in collaboration with  <a href='https://ori.ox.ac.uk/'>Oxford Robotics Institute </a>(supervised by <a href='https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/daniele-de-martini/'>Prof. Daniele De Martini</a>). 

Let's skip to the fun part.
I am deeply passionate about <b>Robotics</b>, specifically in combination with <b>AI</b>.
My <b>dream would be pursuing a PhD in Robotics</b> (in Locomotion/Manipulation).
The full list of my <b>interests</b> is:
- Acquisition and aggregation of skills
- Robotic control through Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Meta-RL
- Locomotion, Manipulation and Loco-Manipulation.
- Application of generative models (LLM/VLM/Diffusion) to perception, planning, and reasoning
- Multi-agent RL

And in my free time? .
