My name is Davide Buoso and I'm from Turin, Italy. I am enrolled in the Data Science and Engineering program at Polytechnique University of Turin. Currently, I am a Visiting Student at the University of Oxford, to complete my Master Thesis. I am working in the Torr Vision Group (under PhD Student Tim Franzmeyer) in collaboration with Oxford Robotics Institute (supervisor Prof. Daniele De Martini). 

Let's skip to the fun part: my interests!
I am deeply passionate about Robotics, specifically in combination with AI.
My dream would be pursuing a PhD in Locomotion/Manipulation based on RL/VLM(or LLM/Foundation Models)

I love to hike and coffee!
