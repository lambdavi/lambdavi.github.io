My name is Davide Buoso and I'm from Turin, Italy. I graduated in Data Science and Engineering at <a href='https://www.polito.it/'>Polytechnic University of Turin</a>. I was a Visiting Student at the <a href='#'>University of Oxford</a>, where I worked with the <a href='https://torrvision.com/index.html'>Torr Vision Group</a> (under PhD Student <a href='https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~frtim/'>Tim Franzmeyer</a> and Prof. Philip Torr) in collaboration with  <a href='https://ori.ox.ac.uk/'>Oxford Robotics Institute </a>(supervised by <a href='https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/daniele-de-martini/'>Dr. Daniele De Martini</a>). 

Now I am a 1st year PhD Student @ <a href="https://vandal.polito.it/">VANDAL Polito </a>.
Let's skip to the fun part.
I am deeply passionate about <b>Robotics</b>, specifically in combination with <b>AI</b>.
The full list of my <b>interests</b> is:
- Acquisition and aggregation of skills for autonomous robots
- Robotic control through Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Planning and Reasoning for Manipulation and Loco-Manipulation.
- Application of generative models (LLM/VLM/Diffusion) to perception, planning, and reasoning

And in my free time? .
